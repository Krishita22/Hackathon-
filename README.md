# ðŸ”¥ Wildfire Risk Minimization with Quantum QUBO

This project uses **Pulser** to simulate **graph coloring** via **QUBO**, modeling wildfire risk by assigning properties into non-overlapping risk zones.

## ðŸ’» Files
- `main.py`: Runs the simulation
- `graph_utils.py`: Builds the sample property graph
- `qubo_utils.py`: Builds QUBO matrix
- `pulser_simulation.py`: Prints QUBO (Pulser-ready)
